# Heat-Flow-in-1D-Ising-lattice
We used the Demon algorithm to study the heat flow in 1D Ising lattice. We assing one demon at a site to monitor the local temperature of the system which helped us to study the temperature gradient of the lattice. Moreover, we determined the heat flux and thermal conductivity of the lattice.
